# Legacy Search Modules

This folder contains the original search modules that were replaced by the unified search system.

## Files

- **`natural_language_search.py`** (919 lines) - Original AI-powered natural language processing
- **`search_api.py`** (682 lines) - Original database search and FastAPI endpoints  
- **`enhanced_search_endpoints.py`** (467 lines) - Additional FastAPI endpoints
- **`streamlit_app_original_1637_lines.py`** (1637 lines) - Original over-engineered Streamlit app
- **`configure_env.py`** (83 lines) - Environment configuration utility

## Why Moved

These modules were replaced by `unified_search.py` which consolidates all search functionality into a single, cleaner system. The Streamlit app was dramatically simplified from 1637 lines to 310 lines (81% reduction) by removing over-engineering and redundant code.

## Status

- ❌ **Not used by current application**
- ✅ **Kept for reference and potential future use**
- ⚠️ **May have dependencies on removed PyTorch packages**

## Migration Summary

### Streamlit App Cleanup (1637 → 310 lines)
- **Removed:** Complex async handling, unused functions, redundant database logic
- **Removed:** Over-complex enrichment process management, debug sections
- **Removed:** Unused CSS classes, complex license analysis UI
- **Maintained:** Core search, filtering, results display, enrichment functionality

### Search Module Consolidation
All functionality from these modules has been consolidated into:
- `unified_search.py` - Single search engine with AI, business logic, and database access
- `enrichment_service.py` - Streamlined data enrichment

## Recovery

If you need to restore any of these modules:
1. Copy the desired file back to the root directory
2. Update imports in other files as needed
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
